What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    You go to a directory and run 'git init' command.  This put git metadata into the directory and turns it into repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    Staging area is the middle place between the working directory and commit.  You put files there when you want to commit them.
